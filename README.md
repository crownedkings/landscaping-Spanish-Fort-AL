Ok, here I am on GitHub, trying to create a very special thing for a client who works in [landscaping Spanish Fort AL](http://www.southernbaylandscaping.com/). I also live on this area and they asked me if I can do a project with Ruby on Rails. I didn't even know about this, but I said yes. I have a lot of experience in building Wordpress sites, installing plugins, even doing some php modifications when needed.

I already installed Rails 5 and managed to get things up and running, I'm gonna have to watch some tutorials about this, to see what I can do next. It's all very interesting, it seems time just flies when you're doing something that requires concentration.

This project is something I really enjoy and I hope to do the right thing. I'll keep you posted on the progress.
